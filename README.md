This project is a copy of the ApprovedDrugs project with minor differences. Instead of using a drop-down menu of ChEMBL id's loaded from the api along with all the molecule data, this one has the user enter a drug name and then fetches just that molecule from the api.

Some possible searches:

Nicotine
Neomycin
Metoprolol
Ofloxacin
Indomethacin
Norfloxacin
Indapamide
Bicalutamide
